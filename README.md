# Scikit-learn Learning

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for learning data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning with scikit-learn.

## Overview

This repository contains practical examples and implementations of various scikit-learn concepts. Each notebook demonstrates a specific technique with real datasets through interactive code cells.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Getting Started

To launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or if you prefer Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Topics Covered

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (Simple Imputer, KNN Imputer, Iterative Imputer)
- Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, Ordinal Encoding)
- Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization, Min-Max Scaling, Robust Scaling)
- Outlier detection and removal (IQR method, Z-score method)
- Feature engineering and transformation

### Machine Learning Algorithms
> **Note:** These topics are planned for future study and will be added as learning progresses.

- Supervised Learning (Classification and Regression)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model evaluation and validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation techniques

### Model Building
> **Note:** These topics are planned for future study and will be added as learning progresses.

- Train-test splitting
- Pipeline creation
- Model selection
- Feature selection
- Ensemble methods

## Usage

Each notebook (`.ipynb` file) is self-contained and can be opened independently in Jupyter:

1. Navigate to the desired directory
2. Click on the notebook file to open it
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`

## Datasets

Sample datasets are included in the `datasets/` directory for practice and demonstration purposes.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new notebooks, techniques, or improvements. This is an active learning repository.
